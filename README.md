# Memory Game Project

## Table of Contents

### How to play

The game begins when you click on any 1 of the 16 cards. This triggers the timer that tracks how long you take to finish the game.

A "move" comprises of 2 clicks (as in 2 guesses). If the 2 match, the open cards stay locked (indicated by green background) and you can move on clicking the other cards. In the event of a mismatch, the cards temporarily display an orange background and then close.

### What the player is to expect from the game.

The objective of the game is to match all the pairs of cards within minimum number of moves and as less time as possible. There is a rating of your performance indicated by the number of stars near the header. The more moves a player takes to complete the game, the lesser the rating he/she ends up with.

This game was developed using:

1. font-awesome,
2. bootstrap.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
